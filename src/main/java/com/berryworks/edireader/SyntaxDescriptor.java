/**
 * Represents the full collection of syntax characters that apply to EDI interchanges.
 * <p>
 * An instance of a SyntaxDescriptor is typically used to describe the particular syntax
 * characters used in a given EDI interchange.
 * The delimiter is the character that separates two consecutive fields in an EDI segment.
 * The subdelimiter is the character that separates two consecutive subfields.
 * The subSubDelimiter the the character that separates two consecutive sub-subfields.
 * (ANSI X12 and EDIFACT standards to no use sub-subfields. This is included for other standards
 * such as HL7.)
 * The decimalMark is the character used in numeric EDI data to represent the radix point.
 * The decimal mark is the often the period but can be a comma or other value.
 * The repetitionSeparator is the character used to separate consecutive instances of
 * field that is allowed to repeat.
 * The terminator is the character used to mark the end of a segment.
 * The terminatorSuffix is a short String of characters that optionally follow the
 * terminator. Such suffixes are typically a LF or CR,LF sequence marking the end of a record.
 * The release character is the used to mark the immediately following character as
 * data and not to be interpreted as a syntax characters.
