Provides a collection of EDI transaction set plugins.
<p>
    When EDIReader is parsing a EDI transaction set, it detects the
    presence of a plugin in the CLASSPATH for that specific transaction set.
    If a plugin is available, EDIReader is able to make SAX calls to reflect
    the segment looping structure as defined by the EDI standard. Therefore,
    if EDIReader is being used to generate XML, the emitted XML reflects
    the nested segment loops implied by the transaction set.
    If no plugin is available, EDIReader makes the SAX calls to reflect a
    "flat" series of segments within the transaction set.
