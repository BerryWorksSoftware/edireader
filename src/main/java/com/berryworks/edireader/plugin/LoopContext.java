/**
 * An object that represents a segment loop within an EDI document.

 * EDIReader uses a LoopStack, which is a stack of LoopContext objects, to track the
 * current nested segment loops while parsing an EDI document.
 * <p>
 * In the UN/EDIFACT EDI standards, a segment loop is typically called
 * a segment group.
 * <p>
 * The primary attribute of a LoopContext instance is simply the name of the segment loop.
 * However, when a ValidatingPlugin is used, the LoopContext is also used to track
 * how many times a given segment has been repeated, which mandatory segment types have been seen,
 * and the current position within an expected ordering of segment types.
