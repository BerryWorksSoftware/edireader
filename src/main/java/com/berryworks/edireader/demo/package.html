Illustrates the basic use of EDIReader and provides some tools useful in getting started with the
product.
<p>
    EdiScanner uses explicit constructors from the package to create and instance of the parser
    and defines a very simple ContentHandler that prints a summary the parsed content. It is
    completely standalone,
    requiring no XML support beyond the basic interfaces necessary for compilation.
</p>

<p>
    EdiToXML extends upon EdiScanner by driving an XLST Transformer of your choice. The simplest
    choice may be to
    use the XSLT support that Sun provides with its J2SE (staring with 1.4), but you can use any one
    you prefer
    with the standard JAXP techniques. EdiToXML does not use an explicit stylesheet for the
    transformation
    but relies on the default behavior which is to simply transform the parsed input into XML output.
    Therefore, this provides a useful tool for materializing an XML file that is the equivalent of the
    EDI input
    as far as the SAX parser is concerned. This is very handy when debugging a stylesheet or testing
    EdiReader.
</p>

<p>
    EdiTransform extends upon EdiToXML by using an XSLT stylesheet with the transformation of the EDI
    input.
    It is invaluable while debugging stylesheets that transform your EDI data into HTML pages, flat
    files,
    XML files with rich tags, or whatever.
