/**
 * Static metadata about a segment loop (also known as a segment group) within an EDI document
 * (also known as transaction set or message). A sequence of LoopDescriptors
 * comprise the essence of a transaction set Plugin which allows a subclass of
 * EDIReader to consider the nested segment loops that are often important to
 * the semantics of a document.
 * <p>
 * <b>Overview.</b>
 * An instance of a LoopDescriptor in a plugin is an expression of a rule.
 * Generally speaking, when an EDIReader parser is parsing an EDI document
 * for which a plugin is available, it consults these LoopDescriptor rules
 * for each segment in the document to determine if the appearance of the
 * segment marks the beginning of a new segment loop.
 * <p>
 * For each segment, the parser evaluates each rule in order
 * and performs the action described
 * by the first rule that applies in the current context.
 * Any remaining rules are ignored, and if no rule is found that applies
 * to the segment in current context, then no action is taken;
 * in other words, the segment is treated simply as another segment in the
 * current segment loop.
 * <p>
 * <b>Basic attributes of a LoopDescriptor.</b>
 * There are four attributes of a LoopDescriptor which are specified in its constructor.
 * <p>
 * The <i>name</i> is simply the name of a segment loop described by this rule.
 * This name will appear as the value of the "Id" attribute in the loop element of the
 * generated XML.
 * There are a few special cases for this attribute that are described below.
 * <p>
 * The <i>nestingLevel</i> indicates how deeply nested is the loop. The segments of an
 * EDI document that are not within a segment loop are considered to be
 * in an implicit outer loop at nesting level 0.
 * <p>
 * The <i>firstSegment</i> attribute is the type of the segment that
 * marks the beginning of a new instance of the described segment loop.
 * For example a "PID" value might be used in a plugin for an ANSI 810 Invoice
 * document to define the segment loop that begins with the PID segment.
 * Similarly, a "LIN" value might be used in a plugin for
 * an EDIFACT INVOIC message to define a loop that begins with an LIN segment.
 * <p>
 * The <i>loopContext</i> attribute places a condition on when the
 * LoopDescriptor applies as described below.
 * <p><b>When does a LoopDescriptor rule apply?</b>
 * When the parser encounters a new segment while parsing an
 * EDI document, it consults LoopDescriptor rules to discover one that might apply.
 * When determining if a particular rule applies, only the firstSegment
 * and loopContext attributes are considered;
 * the other two attributes govern the action take once a rule is selected
 * and have no bearing on the decision of whether or not the rule applies.
 * <p>
 * For a rule to apply, the firstSegment attribute must match exactly the
 * segment type of the segment in the document.
 * Once the segment type is matched to the firstSegment attribute,
 * the loopContext is considered.
 * The value "*",
 * which can be specified by ANY_CONTEXT symbolic constant,
 * indicates that this LoopDescriptor rule applies any time that the
 * segment in the EDI document matches the firstSegment attribute.
 * <p>
 * The loopContext attribute may also begin with a "/" and specify
 * a nested loop path of slash-delimited loop names. For example, a loopContext
 * of "/ABC/DEF/GHI" would indicate a GHI loop nested within a DEF loop
 * nested within an ABC loop which is nested within the implicit outer loop
 * of the document.
 * A segment appearing in an EDI document is considered to match such a
 * LoopDescriptor rule if the segment type matches the firstSegment attribute
 * and the nested segment loop context of that segment in the parsed document
 * is included in the context described by the path.
 * <p>
 * <b>Actions described by a LoopDescriptor.</b>
 * The most obvious action is for the parser to start a new instance of a segment loop,
 * and this action is designated by simply using the desired loop name as the loopName
 * attribute.
 * It is common in some EDI scenarios for loops to be named after the first segment in the loop
 * but this is not necessary.
 * If the new loop instance is at a lower nesting level than the current loop, then the parser
 * generates the proper XML to terminate the current loops as needed.
 * In this way, the LoopDescriptor rules need only describe the conditions for entering a
 * new segment loop, and the parser and supporting framework can determine where the end of
 * each segment loop occurs.
 * <p>
 * A loopName of null indicates an explicit non-action. When a rule of this kind is applied,
 * then no loop transition occurs in the EDI document, and since a matching rule was encountered
 * no further are considered. By placing a null action rule in the sequence of rules for a given
 * segment type, you can in effect eliminate certain conditions and therefore simplify the
 * rules that follow.
 * <p>
 * The value "/" as a loopName indicates re-entry of the current loop at the designated nesting level.
 * The appropriate number of nested loops are properly terminated.
 * <p>
 * <b>Ordering of LoopDescriptors in a Plugin.</b>
 * Remember that the parser considers LoopDescriptors in the order that they appear
 * in the plugin and accepts the first one that matches, ignoring the rest.
 * Therefore, if there are multiple LoopDescriptors for a given segment type,
 * the relative order in which those LoopDescriptors appear is very important
 * to the semantics of the plugin. Whether all of the LoopDescriptors for a given
 * segment type are grouped together or scattered throughout the LoopDescriptor array is
 * not important, only the relative order of LoopDescriptors with respect to others
 * for the same segment type. (For readability, it is suggested that you group LoopDescriptors
 * for a given segment type together, and order those groups alphabetically by segment type.)
 * <p>
 * Within a series of LoopDescriptors for a particular segment type,
 * it is usually a good idea to place those descriptors with the deepest nesting level
 * and longest context path first. In this way, the parser will consider the most
 * specific rules first and, if none of these apply, fall through to the more general rules
 * that cover the "else" conditions.
 * This can simplify the context argument for LoopDescriptors. In fact, it is common for the last
 * LoopDescriptor for a given segment type to use ANY_CONTEXT for its context argument, since the
 * prior LoopDescriptors would have covered all possibilities but one.
 * <p>
 * <b>Plugin Optimization.</b>
 * The description above suggests that the entire array of LoopDescriptors in
 * a plugin is examined serially for each segment within an EDI document.
 * This is logically but not literally true.
 * For performance reasons, an optimized form of a plugin is created when a
 * plugin class is loaded so that the LoopDescriptors associated with a
 * particular segment type can be accessed efficiently. The PluginPreparation
 * class is for this purpose.
